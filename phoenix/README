This is a README for prebuilt package. 

If you are working with the source code tree, use PhoenixStoreReadme.md in the source tree

====== HOWTO run ======

1. You need to have a ready HBase Cluster to test upon

Should be 0.94.5+, better to have hbase version 0.94.7

There is a bug that impact the performance a lot which got fixed in 0.94.9+
check out following issue for more detail:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8639

2. Deploy phoenix jar to HBASE cluster.

Copy lib/phoenix-*-client.jar to everyHBaseNode:path_to_hbase/lib/

3. Tweak some settings accroding to your cluster env.

In bin/config.sh fill in all settings with correct values.

In bin dir, run ./applyconfig.sh to generate some scripts and apply changes
according to the values you have been set into config.sh

4. Run benchmark

preparing database : run loaddata.sh, it will create the table then load the data.
query : doquery.sh

5. Clean up table.

At present, Phoenix do not support drop table thoughly from hbase.
you will need to clean up table on hbase cluster firstly by hand by

disable and drop nodetable, linktable, counttable

then run cleanup.sh to drop table metadata from phoenix system table.


====== Tuning ======

Regarding HBASE, by default, we are using config/hbase-site.xml come with this
prebuilt package. take it as an example for futher tunning or merge it with your
HBase Cluster's existing one.

You can look into README.md and PhoenixStoreReadme.md in the source
tree to understand and tune various other parameters.
